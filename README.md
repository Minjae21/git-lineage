## Description
This is a chatbot that leverages knowledge about a repository's commit history to better answer user queries.

## Project Link

## Architecture
SQL Database: stores information about the codebase, including commits, files, and parsed symbols.

AWS Lambda serves as the core logic layer:
* Handles webhook or batch events from the code repository to ingest new data into the SQL database.
* Responds to user or application queries by combining database context with LLM output.
* Performs queries on the database to enhance LLM context.
  
AWS Bedrock: provides language model inference, and is called by the Lambda function when generating answers or performing semantic analysis.

Lambda â†” Database interaction supports both data ingestion and contextual retrieval for user queries.
